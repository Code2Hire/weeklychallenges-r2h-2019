VERY EASY: Create a bulleted list of the colors of the rainbow 
EASY: Create an HTML page with a main headline, two subheads in their own sections and supporting text for each subhead. Topic is up to you. Make sure you have a page title.
MEDIUM: Create an HTML form with a GET method that will collect the following: First Name, Last Name, Gender (have them pick), Favorite sport (from a dropdown list of at least 5), Checkboxes for what you like on your pizza (from a list of at least 5) and
the submit button should read, "Save".
HARD: Create a horizontal navigation of 5 items, one of the items should have a dropdown menu when you hover over it.
VERY HARD: Given a comma separated string of full names, use JavaScript to create an alphabetical-by-Last-Name, ordered list and have it display in HTML. Make the last names bold and red using CSS (NOT inline styles).
