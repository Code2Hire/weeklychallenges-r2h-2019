VERY EASY:  Create a basic C# console-mode program that simply outputs the text "Hello World".?
 Your program should wait for the user to press a key before the program exits.? 
  
EASY: Create a program that asks the user to enter an integer. If the integer is less than 10, print the message "This number is too small".
 If the integer is greater than or equal to 10, print "This number is big enough".  
 Hint: read a line and then use Int32.TryParse() to convert the text to an integer. 
  
MEDIUM: Write a loop that would print out the following: 
   
********** 
********** 
********** 
********** 
**********   
You can only have the ‘ * ’ character once!
  
HARD: Print a Pyramid? 
    * 
   *** 
  ***** 
 ******* 
********* 
Hints: You can use three loops. The big one contains two smaller loops. The first inner loops takes care of the # of spaces.
 The second inner loop handles the # of stars.
  
VERY HARD:  
Write a program using a switch statement that takes one value from the user and asks about the type of conversion and then
 performs a conversion depending on the type of conversion. If user enters: 
I -> convert from inches to centimeters. 
G -> convert from gallons to liters.
M -> convert from mile to kilometer. 
P -> convert from pound to kilogram. 

If the user enters any other character then show a proper message.
