In a Codepen Collection
VERY EASY: Create a React class component that renders "hello world" in an h1 tag. You don't need props for this one.
EASY:  Pass a prop for "name" into the component you just created so the h1 tag reads, "Hello world, {name}"
MEDIUM: Create a child Contact component inside the original component you created that you pass in a firstName, lastName, and phoneNumber and print out "You need to contact {firstName} {lastName} at {phoneNumber}
HARD: Using an array of contacts, loop through each one and create a new Contact component for each
VERY HARD: In your list of Contacts, have a status icon by each one that starts as orange "Pending" status. Then have a call button that when clicked, changes the state to a green "Done" status.
